# The LAION2B and projections

## About the LAION2B 

For the challenge and demo track, we selected a 10M, 30M, and 100M-size subsets of the English LAION-5B (often called LAION2B) using Contrastive Languageâ€“Image Pre-training (CLIP) embeddings and a set of 10k independent queries to compute a gold standard for each subset.
CLIP vectors are typically 768-dimensional and compared under the cosine similarity. 

A more detailed description can be found here:
```
Schuhmann, C., Beaumont, R., Vencu, R., Gordon, C., Wightman, R., Cherti, M., ... & Jitsev, J. (2022). Laion-5b: An open large-scale dataset for training next generation image-text models. arXiv preprint arXiv:2210.08402.
````

The metadata is publicly available through the [LAION-5B](https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/) effort and the [Hugging face repository](https://huggingface.co/laion). Please note that the LAION-5B dataset contains many NSFW materials that were discarded.

The dataset is divided into parts containing close to 1M vectors. We selected the first 112 parts (0000 to 0111); we used the first part to extract the public query set and the rest to extract the database. The subset use approximately 160GB of space and its associated metadata 20GB (the first 112 parts). Embeddings are distributed using single precision (16bits) floating point vectors bundled in the NumPy data-specific format `.npz`. They can be loaded on most platforms due to the format's popularity.


## Downloading the original data

The embeddings are also publicly available from the original mirror site [https://mystic.the-eye.eu/public/AI/cah/laion5b/embeddings/](https://mystic.the-eye.eu/public/AI/cah/laion5b/embeddings/).

For instance, you can retrieve the first two parts (and its associated meta data) using a typical Linux installation using the terminal, as follows:

```bash

mkdir laion2B-en
cd laion2B-en

curl -O https://mystic.the-eye.eu/public/AI/cah/laion5b/embeddings/laion2B-en/img_emb/img_emb_0000.npy
curl -O https://mystic.the-eye.eu/public/AI/cah/laion5b/embeddings/laion2B-en/laion2B-en-metadata/metadata_0000.parquet
curl -O https://mystic.the-eye.eu/public/AI/cah/laion5b/embeddings/laion2B-en/img_emb/img_emb_0001.npy
curl -O https://mystic.the-eye.eu/public/AI/cah/laion5b/embeddings/laion2B-en/laion2B-en-metadata/metadata_0001.parquet
```

You can download all parts using the following bash script
```bash
for i in {0000..1111}; do
    echo curl -O https://mystic.the-eye.eu/public/AI/cah/laion5b/embeddings/laion2B-en/img_emb/img_emb_$i.npy
done
```

Remove the `echo` command to actually start downloading.

Throubleshooting: You can restart and resume partial downloads adding `-C -` to the `curl` command line, as follows:

```bash
curl -C - -O https://mystic.the-eye.eu/public/AI/cah/laion5b/embeddings/laion2B-en/img_emb/img_emb_0000.npy
```

### Filtering out NSFW to get the precise subsets
Each dataset part has metadata and embedding files. The medatada file is an Apache parquet table where we can find registers containing information like URL, description, and NSFW status, among other fields. Participants must use the NSFW field to obtain a mask for _NSFW_ that should be used to get the desired sub-matrix. 

## Projections

We encourage people to construct their entire data pipeline to handle data for indexing and searching. However, we produced three different lower-dimensional projections that can be used. In particular, we computed two PCA projections using 32 and 96 dimensions and one more projection into binary sketches designed to work with bit-level hamming distance (using 1024 bits). Find below the URLs to download these bundles.

**Note**: All these projections will reduce the result's quality with respect to the original embeddings. We will mention the kind of input used in the rank, but the rank will be global. The original data can be downloaded from the active LAION2B mirror instead. The metadata, if needed, should also be retrieved from the LAION2B mirror.


### Some technical specifications of the LAION-5B and the CLIP embeddings
 We provide different low dimensional projections packed in `HDF5`; queries and gold standards are also HDF5, i.e., `.h5` files. HDF5 can perform faster and more flexible _io_, which can help on large datasets. In particular, the sizes of the projection files are as follow:

```julia:./datasets/table
#hideall
urls = Dict()
sizes = Dict()
md5s = Dict()

for line in readlines("dataset-files-urls.txt")
    urls[basename(line)] = line
end

for line in readlines("dataset-files-size.txt")
    s, name = split(line)
    sizes[basename(name)] = s
end

for line in readlines("dataset-files-md5.txt")
    s, name = split(line)
    md5s[basename(name)] = s
end

function tablehead() 
    println("| dataset | description | size | md5      |")
    println("|---------|-------------|------|----------|")
end
