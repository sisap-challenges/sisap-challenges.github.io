# SISAP Indexing Challenge 

The International Conference on Similarity Search and Applications (SISAP) is an annual forum for researchers and application developers in the area of similarity data management. It aims at the technological problems shared by numerous application domains, such as data mining, information retrieval, multimedia, computer vision, pattern recognition, computational biology, geography, biometrics, machine learning, and many others that use similarity search as a necessary supporting service. Machine learning, dense retrieval, and multimedia indexing have taken the scene of similarity search as the most challenging task among applications. This call reflects on this observation.


## Open challenge
The open call for implementation is on the [SISAP 2024 Indexing Challenge](/2024/) with tasks of interest for the research community and the information industry.


## Past editions
In 2023 we launched the [SISAP 2023 Indexing Challenge](/2023/) with a test bed to compare new and existing indexing algorithms in three common tasks.
