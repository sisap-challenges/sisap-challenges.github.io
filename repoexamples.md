# About repositories and continuous integration setup
The reproducibility of search methods is essential. We encourage sharing solutions using public GitHub repositories, preferentially under an open-source license to boost its usage and simplify its reproducibility by the community. Of course, repository documentation, notebooks, and tutorials are always welcome.

In the same terms, we ask for using GHA to ensure reproducibility under a limited-size dataset. GHA is a continuous integration platform that can run specified scripts after a repository is updated. We plan to use GHA to ask participants to ensure that indexing and searching methods work in one of the supported platforms. For this matter, we will prepare a small subset of the dataset, and a small query sets allow checking that at least these functions work. We will provide examples of projects working with GHA for Python and Julia programming languages (listed in the challenge's site.)
